# That Conference 2019 - Introduction to Graph Databases

An introduction to Graph Databases. Presented at the 2019 [That Conference](https://www.thatconference.com/).

The presentation will be on Wed, [Aug 7 at 1:00 PM CST (6:00 PM UCT)](https://www.thatconference.com/Sessions/Session/13848)

## Abstract

In this talk we will take a look at the lay of the land for Graph databases, as they continue to explode in popularity.

Graph databases are a noSQL database that focuses on the relationships in data. Systems are composed of vertices, which is the entity you are concerned with such as a person, place or even and an edge, which defines the relationship between these vertices.

Systematizing data this way can have many benefits, one of the biggest being is this tends to be how we define data as humans. They are great for modelling social interactions and domains where connections can be more important than rigidity of data. It can solve issues where the complexity of the interactions between objects are not easily solved in a traditional SQL world. Obvious very popular systems using Graph databases are Twitter and FaceBook.

In this presentation, we are going to look at the various players in the Graph Database world such as Neo4j and Gremlin databases. We will then look at writing a simple program and take a look at the Cypher query language and examining the power of this platform compared to traditional approaches.

You will leave with a newfound awareness at the class of problems graph databases can solve.

And for the record, Graph databases have nothing (directly) to do with GraphQL, that is a whole other talk!
