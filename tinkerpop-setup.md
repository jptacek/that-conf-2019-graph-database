If Java is not installed you can grab the latest version for your OS of choice at [Orcacle's website](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk12-downloads-5295953.html).

We are going to need to install the server and console for Gremlin. THere are many implementations, we are going to use the Apache TinkerPop implemention
